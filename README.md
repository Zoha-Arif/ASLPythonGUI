# ü§ü ASL Python GUI

An interactive desktop application that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real time using computer vision and machine learning.

Enables users to communicate through ASL by:
- Capturing live video from a webcam
- Recognizing ASL letters or words using a neural network model
- Displaying recognized text dynamically in a user-friendly GUI

## üß† Features

- **Real-time ASL recognition** via webcam input
- **Built with Keras / TensorFlow**, using a trained model to interpret hand gestures
- **Simple GUI interface** built in Python (Tkinter) to display video feed and recognized text
- **Gesture-to-text mapping** for clear on-screen feedback
- **Timestamped logging** of input sessions or files
